<!-- plan for the Resources page:
	Create multiple databasess, maybe 3 - Crop, Equipment, Workers
	(change the table design layout to make it more readable)
	1) Crop has two inputs - name and stock. (maybe a seasonal tag that prevents them from growing in wrong seasons)
	2) Equipment only has a name input. Could maybe add a feature on the add new equipment page to add multiple of an item to the database
	3) Workers only needs a name input (maybe add a salary option for further management capeabilites)

	also I need to figure out how to tie a database to a user rather then it being global.
